A Node.js project using TypeScript and Empress.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
npm install
```

## Scripts

The project provides several npm scripts for development and production use:

- `build`: Compiles TypeScript files
- `dev:server`: Starts the development server with hot reload
- `start`: Runs the application in production mode
- `lint`: Lints the project files
- `fix`: Auto-fixes lint issues
- `test`: Runs the test suite

Run scripts using:

```sh
npm run <script>
```

## Running the Server

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev:server
```

Start the production server:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Linting

Check for linting issues:

```sh
npm run lint
```

Fix linting issues automatically:

```sh
npm run fix
```
